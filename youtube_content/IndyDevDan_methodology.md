# IndyDevDan Agentic Coding Methodology

## Core Philosophy

### The Fundamental Principle
**"Context is KING"** - If your AI agent can't see critical information, it simply cannot build what you need. This drives every other principle and practice.

### Agentic vs AI Coding
- **AI Coding**: Iterative prompting back and forth with your coding tool
- **Agentic Coding**: Self-validating loops, planning, testing - the whole development lifecycle
- **Key Insight**: Agentic coding is a massive superset of AI coding

## The 3 Essential Directories System

### Purpose
Three simple folders that unlock AI coding superpower for every project you touch, making AI tools understand your codebase better and faster than you can read the README.

### Directory 1: AI Docs
**Purpose**: Persistent memory palace for your AI coding tools

**What Goes Inside**:
- Third-party API documentation and integration details
- Custom patterns and conventions specific to your codebase
- Implementation notes and project-specific knowledge
- Anything that provides essential context for AI tools

**Philosophy**: This is your AI tool's persistent database that you can quickly ramp up across projects over and over.

### Directory 2: Specs
**Purpose**: Plans and specifications - "The plan IS the prompt"

**Core Concept**: 
- These are the new units of getting massive amounts of work done
- Where you scale up your compute and do more work than ever in single massive swings
- The most important folder in your entire codebase

**Philosophy**: 
- Great planning is great prompting
- You can scale up what you can do by writing detailed, comprehensive specs
- Hand this work off to your AI coding tools and they will get the work done

### Directory 3: .claude (or equivalent)
**Purpose**: Reusable prompts and commands for any AI coding tool

**What Goes Inside**:
- Context priming prompts for quick setup
- Reusable workflows that work across sessions
- Commands that help you quickly operate on the files and ideas that matter

**Philosophy**: Make it easy to set up new instances of your agentic tooling over time, both day-to-day and session-to-session.

## Core Principles

### 1. Context Management
- **Balance is Critical**: Too much context confuses agents, too little prevents work
- **Focused Context**: Give AI tools access to essential information without overwhelming them
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Build up context that survives across sessions and projects

### 2. Plan-First Development
- **"The Plan IS the Prompt"**: Detailed specs become executable prompts
- **Scale Through Planning**: Write comprehensive plans to hand off more work to AI tools
- **Avoid Iterative Waste**: Sit down, take time, think, plan, then build

### 3. Reusability and Scale
- **Create Once, Use Everywhere**: Build reusable patterns across projects and time
- **Context Priming**: Set up agents with essential information quickly
- **Workflow Patterns**: Develop repeatable approaches for common development tasks

### 4. Self-Validation
- **Built-in Testing**: Include validation and testing in every workflow
- **Quality Loops**: Create processes that verify their own success
- **Continuous Improvement**: Build feedback mechanisms into your development process

## Key Insights from Practice

### Context Window Management
- AI coding tools will eventually run out of context (200K-1M tokens typically)
- You'll have to reset, so prepare for this with context priming
- Design workflows that can quickly re-establish essential context

### The Power of Structure
- Having these three directories gives your agentic coding workflow an instant memory palace
- Any AI coding assistant can understand your project in seconds with proper structure
- The structure keeps your AI on target and your token bill low

### Tool Agnostic Benefits
- This methodology works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or any AI coding tool
- The principles transfer across different AI assistants
- Focus on the patterns and principles, not specific tools

## Implementation Guidelines

### Start Simple
- Begin with the basic three-folder structure
- Add complexity only when it provides clear value
- Focus on your actual development needs, not theoretical completeness

### Adapt to Your Project
- Tailor the contents to your specific tech stack and patterns
- Don't create generic templates - make everything project-specific
- Evolve the structure as your project and needs grow

### Measure Effectiveness
- Evaluate based on how much it improves your AI-assisted development
- Test whether AI tools understand your project faster and better
- Adjust based on real usage patterns and developer experience

## Philosophy Summary

### The Big Idea
Make it easy for AI tools to understand and work with your project by providing the right context, at the right time, in the right format. This enables you to scale your engineering work beyond what traditional iterative AI coding allows.

### Success Criteria
- AI tools understand your project faster than you can read the README
- You can hand off substantial work to AI assistants with confidence
- Your development workflow scales across projects and over time
- Context management becomes automatic rather than manual

### Long-term Vision
Move toward repositories that build themselves through proper agentic coding structure and methodology. The goal is to scale engineering work through intelligent context management and reusable agentic workflows.
