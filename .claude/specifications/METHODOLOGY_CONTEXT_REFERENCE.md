  - Construct integration tests to verify cross-module compatibility
  - Simulate failure conditions, invalid inputs, and stress tests
  - Perform security checks for input validation, authentication, file handling, and injection vulnerabilities
  - Reject and demand fixes for any untested or insecure code
- **Communication Style**: Precise, no-nonsense, direct, zero tolerance for errors, results-driven

## üìã PRP METHODOLOGY (Product Requirements Process)

### **Purpose**
Research-driven specification creation that prevents hallucination and ensures evidence-based development.

### **Core Process**
1. **Understand the Context**
   - Ask clarifying questions about the product, feature, or problem
   - Identify stakeholders and target users
   - Understand business context and strategic goals
   - Review existing documentation or research

2. **Research and Analysis Phase**
   - Conduct market research on similar solutions and competitors
   - Research user pain points and validation data
   - Analyze business impact and opportunities
   - Investigate technical considerations and constraints

3. **Guided Specification Creation**
   - Work through each section systematically
   - Ask probing questions to extract comprehensive information
   - Ensure each section is well-supported with evidence and reasoning
   - Validate assumptions and identify areas needing more research

4. **Quality Assurance and Refinement**
   - Review complete specification for coherence and completeness
   - Ensure alignment between problem, solution, and success metrics
   - Check that business value is clearly articulated
   - Verify that alternatives were properly considered

### **PRP Template Structure**
```markdown
# [Descriptive Title] **PRP**

## Our users have this problem:
[Clear problem statement with evidence]

## To solve it, we should do this:
[Proposed solution with rationale]

## Then, our users will be better off, like this:
[Expected user benefits and outcomes]

## This is good for business, because:
[Business value and strategic alignment]

## Here's how we'll know if it worked:
[Success metrics and measurement plan]

## Here are other things we considered:
[Alternative solutions and why they weren't chosen]
```

### **Confidence Scoring System**
- **1-3**: Low confidence - Significant unknowns, high risk
- **4-6**: Medium confidence - Some unknowns, manageable risk
- **7-8**: High confidence - Well-researched, low risk
- **9-10**: Very high confidence - Comprehensive research, minimal risk

## üîÑ INDYDEVDAN PRINCIPLES

### **Core Principles**
1. **"Documentation is source of truth"** - Always use fresh, official documentation over knowledge
2. **"Research first, implement second"** - Never assume, always research and validate
3. **"Context is KING"** - Load comprehensive context before any development work
4. **"Take my tech as sacred truth"** - User specifications are absolute, research them thoroughly
5. **"Agents are intelligent human beings"** - Multi-agent systems should use reasoning, not programmatic solutions
6. **"Great planning is great prompting"** - The plan IS the prompt for implementation
7. **"Anti-hallucination through research"** - Prevent AI hallucination through systematic research validation

### **Implementation Patterns**
- **3-Folder System**: `/ai-docs/`, `/specs/`, `.claude/` for organized development
- **Multi-Vector Research**: Research from multiple official sources and cross-validate
- **Progressive Sophistication**: Start simple, add complexity systematically
- **Agentic Workflows**: 5+ prompts per agent for unique, reasoned content

## üîÅ INFINITE AGENTIC LOOP PATTERN

### **Concept**
Higher-order prompts that take other prompts as parameters, enabling scalable parallel agent deployment.

### **Pattern Structure**
```markdown
Master Prompt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Takes Specification as Input (Higher-Order)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deploys Multiple Sub-Agents in Parallel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Each Sub-Agent Works on Isolated Component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Aggregates Results into Cohesive Output
```

### **Implementation Example**
```markdown
/infinite-implement [specification-file] [output-directory] [agent-count]
‚Üí Reads specification
‚Üí Spawns N parallel agents
‚Üí Each agent implements different aspects
‚Üí Combines results into complete implementation
```

### **Benefits**
- Parallel processing of complex tasks
- Scalable agent deployment
- Isolated component development
- Systematic result aggregation

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### **Multi-Vector Research**
Research pattern that gathers information from multiple sources and cross-validates:
1. **Vector 1**: Official documentation
2. **Vector 2**: Implementation examples
3. **Vector 3**: Best practices and patterns
4. **Vector 4**: Integration and compatibility information
5. **Cross-Validation**: Compare all vectors for consistency

### **Quality Gates**
Systematic checkpoints that prevent progression until criteria are met:
- **Entry Criteria**: Requirements for starting a phase
- **Process Criteria**: Requirements during phase execution
- **Exit Criteria**: Requirements for completing a phase
- **Validation Methods**: How criteria are verified

### **A-F Development Cycle** (CODEFARM Methodology)
- **Phase A**: Feature Definition & Scope (CodeFarmer leads)
- **Phase B**: Critical Questioning & Gap Identification (Critibot leads)
- **Phase C**: Implementation Proposal & Options (Programmatron leads)
- **Phase D**: Automated Testing & Security Validation (TestBot leads)
- **Phase E**: Revision & Enhancement (Collaborative)
- **Phase F**: Final Implementation & Documentation (Programmatron leads)
