# CODEFARM Operational Commands Implementation Roadmap
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Purpose**: Strategic implementation plan for validated legacy code management operational commands

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Validated Operational Commands Ready for Implementation:**

1. **`/codefarm-audit-legacy [project-path]`** - Legacy code health assessment and unknown issue discovery
2. **`/codefarm-systematize [legacy-project-path]`** - Legacy codebase reorganization to methodology standards

### **Strategic Justification:**
Both commands address genuine **legacy code systematization** needs not covered by the existing 7-phase development methodology. They extend systematic approaches to legacy code management rather than duplicating existing capabilities.

### **Implementation Decision:**
‚úÖ **PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION** - Both commands meet enhanced validation criteria with strong strategic necessity and user experience design.

## üß™ TESTING & VALIDATION STRATEGY

### **Command Effectiveness Validation Framework**

#### **`/codefarm-audit-legacy` Testing:**

**Validation Scenarios:**
1. **Known Issue Discovery**: Test with legacy code containing known problems
2. **Unknown Issue Discovery**: Validate discovery of hidden risks not obvious to manual review
3. **Risk Prioritization Accuracy**: Confirm high-priority risks are genuinely critical
4. **False Positive Rate**: Ensure risk assessments are accurate, not overly conservative

**Success Criteria:**
- Discovers ‚â•90% of known issues in test codebases
- Identifies ‚â•3 genuinely critical unknown issues per moderate-complexity legacy project
- Risk prioritization aligns with actual production impact (validated through follow-up)
- False positive rate <15% for high-priority risk assessments

#### **`/codefarm-systematize` Testing:**

**Validation Scenarios:**
1. **Functionality Preservation**: Reorganize test projects and validate no behavioral changes
2. **Methodology Compliance**: Verify reorganized projects meet all 7-phase methodology standards
3. **Integration Preservation**: Ensure external integrations work unchanged after reorganization
4. **Development Workflow**: Validate systematic development commands work with reorganized projects

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% functionality preservation (all tests pass, integrations work unchanged)
- 100% methodology compliance (all 7-phase standards implemented correctly)
- Systematic development commands work seamlessly with reorganized projects
- Developer workflow improvement measurable (faster onboarding, easier maintenance)
