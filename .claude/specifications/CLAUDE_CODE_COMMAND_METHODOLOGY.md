## üéØ COMMAND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### **Purpose-Driven Development**

**Core Principle**: Every command serves a specific objective with appropriate tools and validation

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH:**
- **Start with purpose**: What specific problem does this command solve?
- **Design for objective**: Structure, tools, and validation match the goal
- **Use patterns as inspiration**: Learn from successful commands, don't copy templates
- **Validate appropriately**: Success criteria aligned with command purpose

**‚ùå INCORRECT APPROACH:**
- **Template-driven design**: Force all commands into identical structure
- **Tool copying**: Use same tools regardless of actual requirements
- **Uniform validation**: Apply same quality gates regardless of purpose
- **Structural rigidity**: Make structure more important than function
- **Meta-process solutions**: Creating processes to prevent processes (recursive contamination)
- **Solution theater**: Complex solutions that create problems they then solve

## üß† FRAMEWORK APPLICATION: FPT + HTN + CoT

### **Framework Selection Matrix:**

| Scenario Type | Framework | Use Case | Example Commands |
|---------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Analysis-Heavy** | **FPT + CoT** | Research validation, gap analysis, assessment | `/codefarm-anti-hallucination` |
| **Execution-Heavy** | **HTN + CoT** | Deployment, automation, multi-phase workflows | `/codefarm-organize-legacy-v4` |
| **Hybrid Complex** | **FPT + HTN + CoT** | Complex resolution, transformation, systematic implementation | `/codefarm-resolve-gordian` |

### **Framework Components:**

**First Principles Thinking (FPT):**
- Start with fundamental evidence and constraints
- Question assumptions systematically
- Build understanding from validated foundation
- Apply when deep analysis required

**Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN):**
- Decompose complex goals into manageable phases
- Enable conditional execution based on results
- Structure systematic workflow progression
- Apply when multi-step execution required

**Chain of Thought (CoT):**
- Explicit reasoning at each decision point
- Transparent methodology for validation
- Step-by-step logical progression
- Apply in ALL commands for clarity

## üõ†Ô∏è COMMAND STRUCTURE STANDARDS

### **YAML Header Requirements:**

```yaml
---
description: [Purpose-specific description - max 80 characters]
allowed-tools: [Only tools actually needed for command purpose]
argument-hint: [project-path] - [Clear indication of expected input]
---
```

**Description Guidelines:**
- Specific to command purpose
- Actionable and clear
- Under 80 characters for CLI compatibility

**Tool Selection Principles:**
- **Match to purpose**: Only include tools the command actually uses
- **No template copying**: Don't include tools just because other commands have them
- **Consider workflow**: Analysis vs implementation vs execution needs

### **Multi-Agent Activation Pattern:**

**Standard Agent Roles:**
- **CodeFarmer**: Strategic analysis, planning, and requirement synthesis
- **Critibot**: Validation, safety protocols, and quality assurance
- **Programmatron**: Implementation, execution, and systematic construction
- **TestBot**: Effectiveness validation, testing, and verification

**Agent Specialization by Purpose:**
```markdown
# Analysis Command Example:
**CodeFarmer (Research Mapping Analyst):** [Specific analysis role]
**Critibot (Validation Controller):** [Specific validation role]
**Programmatron (Documentation Architect):** [Specific implementation role]
**TestBot (Effectiveness Validator):** [Specific testing role]
```

## üîß TOOL USAGE METHODOLOGY

### **Tool Categories & Applications:**

**Analysis Tools:**
- **LS**: Directory structure understanding
- **Glob**: File pattern discovery
- **Grep**: Content analysis and pattern matching
- **Read**: Detailed file content examination

**Implementation Tools:**
- **Write**: Create new files and documentation
- **Edit**: Modify existing files with precision
- **MultiEdit**: Batch modifications across files

**Execution Tools:**
- **Bash**: File manipulation, system operations
- **Task**: Complex multi-step coordination

### **Tool Selection Guidelines:**

**For Analysis Commands** (like anti-hallucination):
```yaml
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob, Grep, LS
# Focus on understanding and documentation generation
```

**For Organization Commands** (like legacy-v4):
```yaml
allowed-tools: LS, Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash
# Include file manipulation and systematic reorganization
```

**For Complex Orchestration Commands**:
```yaml
allowed-tools: LS, Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Task
# Full tool suite for comprehensive multi-phase operations
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA DESIGN

### **Purpose-Specific Validation:**

**Analysis Commands:**
- Evidence quality and comprehensiveness
- Gap identification accuracy

## üéØ COMMAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

### **Step 1: Purpose Definition**
1. **Identify specific objective**: What problem does this command solve?
2. **Define target scenario**: When would users need this command?
3. **Establish success criteria**: How will we measure effectiveness?
4. **Determine complexity level**: Analysis, execution, or hybrid?

### **Step 2: Framework Selection**
1. **Analyze requirements**: What type of reasoning is needed?
2. **Select appropriate framework**: FPT, HTN, CoT, or combination
3. **Design agent specialization**: Tailor roles to command purpose
4. **Structure workflow phases**: Match framework to objective

### **Step 3: Tool Requirement Analysis**
1. **Map workflow to tools**: What operations are actually needed?
2. **Select minimal tool set**: Only tools that serve the purpose
3. **Validate tool necessity**: Can command achieve goals with selected tools?
4. **Avoid template copying**: Don't add tools just because other commands have them

### **Step 4: Validation Framework Design**
1. **Purpose-specific criteria**: Success measures that match command objective
2. **Evidence-based validation**: All claims backed by verifiable results
3. **Anti-hallucination measures**: Prevent deviations from systematic methodology
4. **Measurable outcomes**: Quantifiable success indicators

## üí° COMMAND DEVELOPMENT INSIGHTS

### **Key Learning:**
1. **Purpose drives design**: Structure follows function, not template
2. **Framework flexibility**: Match reasoning approach to actual requirements
3. **Tool minimalism**: Use only what's needed for the objective
4. **Validation specificity**: Success criteria must match command purpose
5. **Anti-hallucination focus**: Evidence-based validation prevents deviations

### **Common Pitfalls:**
1. **Template copying**: Forcing all commands into identical structure
2. **Tool bloat**: Including tools without specific purpose
3. **Framework misalignment**: Using complex frameworks for simple tasks
4. **Validation mismatch**: Applying wrong success criteria to command purpose
5. **Meta-process solutions**: Creating processes to solve process problems (creates more problems)
6. **Solution theater**: Commands that create problems then solve the problems they created

### **Critical Learning from /codefarm-forensic-reconstruction:**
- **Original Problem**: Command auto-executed implementation without user approval
- **Root Cause**: Missing pause point in Chain of Thought workflow
- **Solution Applied**: Fixed pause point mechanism to require explicit user confirmation
- **Successful Resolution**: Command now properly pauses for user approval, executed successfully
- **Current Status**: Production-ready system validated, forensic reconstruction complete
- **Key Insight**: Proper pause points essential for user-controlled command execution
