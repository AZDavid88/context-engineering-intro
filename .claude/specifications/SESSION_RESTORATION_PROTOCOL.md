# Session Restoration Protocol
**Purpose**: Complete procedure for restoring methodology context in fresh Claude instances

---

## üîÑ RESTORATION SEQUENCE

### **Step 1: Activate CODEFARM Methodology**
```markdown
activate CODEFARM
```
This reads: `/workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.persona/CODEFARM.txt`

### **Step 2: Load Complete Context**
```markdown
Read the following files in order:

1. @.claude/specifications/METHODOLOGY_CONTEXT_REFERENCE.md
   - Complete methodology definitions and principles
   
2. @.claude/specifications/PROCESS_ENFORCING_DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md
   - Main methodology specification
   
3. @.claude/specifications/COMMAND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   - Operational command reference
   
4. @projects/quant_trading/planning_prp.md (first 200 lines)
   - Current project context and status
```

### **Step 3: Verify Context Loading**
Ask Claude to confirm understanding:
```markdown
"Please confirm you understand:
1. CODEFARM multi-agent methodology (CodeFarmer, Critibot, Programmatron, TestBot)
2. Process-enforcing command suite (15 commands across 7 phases)
3. PRP methodology for research-driven specifications
4. Current quant trading project status and architecture"
```

### **Step 4: Resume Development**
Continue with appropriate command for current development phase.

## üìã QUICK CONTEXT VERIFICATION

### **Essential Knowledge Check**
Fresh Claude instance should understand:

**CODEFARM System:**
- ‚úÖ Four agent roles and responsibilities
- ‚úÖ A-F development cycle methodology
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent interaction patterns

**Process Commands:**
- ‚úÖ 15 process-enforcing commands
- ‚úÖ Phase-based development workflow
- ‚úÖ Quality gates and validation requirements

**Integration Principles:**
- ‚úÖ PRP methodology for specifications
- ‚úÖ Research-first anti-hallucination approach
- ‚úÖ File-based context persistence strategy

**Project Context:**
- ‚úÖ Quant trading system architecture
- ‚úÖ Current development phase and priorities
- ‚úÖ Key integration challenges and solutions

## üö® EMERGENCY RESTORATION

### **If Context Loading Fails**
1. **Verify file paths exist**
2. **Read files individually** rather than batch
3. **Summarize key points** from each file manually
4. **Test methodology understanding** before proceeding

### **Minimal Context Restoration**
If full restoration fails, minimum required context:

```markdown
Essential Files (in order of priority):
1. @.persona/CODEFARM.txt - Multi-agent methodology
2. @.claude/specifications/METHODOLOGY_CONTEXT_REFERENCE.md - Core definitions
3. @.claude/specifications/COMMAND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Command usage
```

## üéØ RESTORATION SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Context Successfully Restored When:**
- ‚úÖ Claude can explain CODEFARM methodology
- ‚úÖ Claude knows all 15 process-enforcing commands
- ‚úÖ Claude understands current project status
- ‚úÖ Claude can proceed with systematic development

### **Context Restoration Failed When:**
- ‚ùå Claude doesn't recognize CODEFARM agents
- ‚ùå Claude suggests ad-hoc development approaches
- ‚ùå Claude doesn't enforce process discipline
- ‚ùå Claude makes assumptions without research
