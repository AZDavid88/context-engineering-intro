   - Main methodology specification
   
3. @.claude/specifications/COMMAND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   - Operational command reference
   
4. @.claude/specifications/FPT_METHODOLOGY_COMPLETION_STATUS.md
   - Current completion status and next steps
```

### **Step 3: Verify Methodology Completion Status**
Ask Claude to confirm understanding:
```markdown
"Please confirm you understand:
1. CODEFARM multi-agent methodology with FPT enhancement
2. Complete 7-phase command suite (all phases 1-7 created and saved)
3. Fibonacci progression mathematical pattern completion
4. Operational phase gap analysis and expansion requirements
5. Current status: Development methodology complete, operational expansion needed"
