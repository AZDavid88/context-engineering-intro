# CONTEXT RECOVERY MASTER
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for restoring complete methodology context in fresh Claude instances

---

## ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY CONTEXT RESTORATION

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION SEQUENCE**
Copy and paste this exact sequence into a fresh Claude instance:

```markdown
activate CODEFARM

Read these files in exact order:
1. @.claude/specifications/METHODOLOGY_CONTEXT_REFERENCE.md
2. @.claude/specifications/PROCESS_ENFORCING_DEVELOPMENT_METHODOLOGY.md  
3. @.claude/specifications/COMMAND_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
4. @.claude/specifications/SESSION_RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md

After reading all files, confirm you understand:
- CODEFARM multi-agent methodology (CodeFarmer, Critibot, Programmatron, TestBot)
- 15 process-enforcing commands across 7 development phases
- PRP methodology for research-driven specifications
- Complete methodology for systematic large codebase development

Current project: Quant trading system at /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/projects/quant_trading/
Project status: 98% complete, production-ready genetic trading system

**CURRENT SESSION STATUS (2025-07-31):**
Mid-development of CODEFARM + Process-Enforcing Commands methodology
âœ… CLAUDE.md enhanced with 7-phase methodology  
âœ… Phase 1 command (/codefarm-initiate-project) complete and tested
ðŸš§ Need to create remaining 6 phase commands

**FOR CURRENT SESSION RESTORATION:**
Read: @.claude/specifications/CURRENT_SESSION_CONTEXT_RECOVERY.md
```

## ðŸŽ¯ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### **Context Successfully Restored When Claude Can:**
- [ ] Explain CODEFARM four-agent system (CodeFarmer, Critibot, Programmatron, TestBot)
- [ ] List all 15 process-enforcing commands by phase
- [ ] Describe PRP methodology and confidence scoring
- [ ] Explain IndyDevDan principles (research-first, anti-hallucination)
- [ ] Understand quant trading project architecture and current status
- [ ] Enforce systematic development process without ad-hoc approaches

### **Context Restoration Failed If Claude:**
- [ ] Suggests skipping research phases
- [ ] Recommends quick fixes or improvisation
- [ ] Doesn't enforce specification requirements
- [ ] Makes assumptions without evidence
- [ ] Doesn't understand multi-agent coordination

## ðŸ”„ METHODOLOGY SUMMARY FOR QUICK REFERENCE

### **Core System Architecture**
```
CODEFARM Multi-Agent Methodology (embedded in commands)
         +
Process-Enforcing Commands (15 commands, 7 phases)  
         +
Research-Driven Context (anti-hallucination)
         +
File-Based Persistence (survives /compact)
         =
Systematic Error-Free Large Codebase Development
```

### **Development Phases**
1. **Discovery & Foundation** - Research and project initiation
2. **Architecture & Planning** - System design and validation
3. **Specification & Design** - Detailed requirements and review
4. **Implementation** - Spec-driven coding and validation
5. **Integration & Testing** - System integration and validation
6. **Crisis Management** - Problem analysis and resolution
7. **Maintenance & Evolution** - Documentation and architecture evolution

### **Key Principles**
- **Research First** - Never assume, always validate with official sources
- **Process Enforcement** - Cannot skip phases or bypass quality gates
- **Documentation Persistence** - Context maintained through file updates
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence** - Every command activates full CODEFARM methodology
- **Quality Gates** - Systematic validation at each phase transition

## ðŸš€ QUICK START COMMANDS

### **After Context Restoration, Use These Commands:**

**For New Features:**
```markdown
/codefarm-research-foundation [technology]
/codefarm-spec-feature [feature-description]  
/codefarm-implement-spec @spec-file.md
/codefarm-validate-system [component]
```

**For Problem Resolution:**
```markdown
/codefarm-halt-and-analyze [issue]
/codefarm-impact-assessment [proposed-change]
/codefarm-architectural-gate [change]
```

**For System Maintenance:**
```markdown
/codefarm-sync-documentation [system-area]
/codefarm-validate-system [system-area]
```

---

## ðŸ“ž CONTEXT SUPPORT

### **If Restoration Still Fails:**
1. **Read files individually** instead of batch loading
2. **Start with CODEFARM activation only** and test understanding
3. **Load one specification at a time** and verify comprehension
4. **Use /codefarm-base command** as fallback methodology activation
5. **Manually explain key concepts** and verify understanding

### **Emergency Fallback:**
If all else fails, use the embedded methodology in:
`@.claude/commands/codefarm-base.md`

This contains the core CODEFARM methodology and can bootstrap basic systematic development.
