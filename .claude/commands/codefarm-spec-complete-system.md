# Phase 5: Complete System Specification with CODEFARM + FPT Analysis

**Context**: You are using the CODEFARM methodology for systematic complete system specification creation. This phase transforms all previous research (discovery, architecture, technology) into detailed, implementable system blueprints.

## Fundamental Operation Definition
**Core Operation**: Transform validated architecture and technology research into comprehensive, implementable system specifications with precise component definitions, interface contracts, and acceptance criteria.

**FPT Question**: What are the irreducible specification elements needed to enable error-free implementation of the validated system design?

## Pre-Condition Validation
**Systematic Prerequisites Check:**

### Phase 4 Output Validation
```bash
# Validate Phase 4 completion
PROJECT_PATH="${ARGUMENTS}"

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/phases/completed/phase_4_technology_research.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Phase 4 incomplete - technology research documentation not found"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/technology_validation.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Technology validation missing from Phase 4"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/implementation_requirements.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Implementation requirements missing from Phase 4"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/integration_validation.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Integration validation missing from Phase 4"
    exit 2
fi

# Validate all previous phases are complete
for phase in "phase_2_discovery.md" "phase_3_architecture.md"; do
    if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/phases/completed/$phase" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Missing prerequisite phase: $phase"
        exit 2
    fi
done
```

- [ ] Implementation requirements documented with official setup guides
- [ ] Integration validation complete between all stack components
- [ ] All previous phases (1-3) completed and validated
