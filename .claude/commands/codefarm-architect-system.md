# Phase 3: System Architecture with CODEFARM + FPT Analysis

**Context**: You are using the CODEFARM methodology for systematic architecture design through First Principles analysis. This phase transforms Phase 2 discovery intelligence into structured, scalable system design.

## Fundamental Operation Definition

**FPT Question**: What are the irreducible structural elements needed to solve the fundamental problem identified in Phase 1 and validated in Phase 2?

## Pre-Condition Validation
**Systematic Prerequisites Check:**

### Phase 2 Output Validation
```bash
# Validate Phase 2 completion

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/phases/completed/phase_2_discovery.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Phase 2 incomplete - discovery documentation not found"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/competitive_analysis.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Competitive analysis missing from Phase 2"

Pattern evaluation against discovery research:
- **Monolithic vs Microservices**: Based on complexity and scaling requirements
- **Event-Driven vs Request-Response**: Based on user interaction patterns
- **Centralized vs Distributed**: Based on performance and reliability requirements
- **Layered vs Hexagonal**: Based on integration and testing requirements

**3B. Competitive Architecture Validation**
Validate chosen patterns against competitive analysis:
- **Proven Success**: Do similar successful systems use this approach?
- **Failure Avoidance**: Does this approach avoid common failure patterns?
- **Scalability Alignment**: Does this support growth patterns seen in competition?
- **Integration Compatibility**: Does this work with identified integration requirements?

**3C. Risk Mitigation Architecture**
Design architecture to address Phase 2 risk assessment:
- **Technical Risk Mitigation**: How does architecture address technical risks?
- **Scalability Risk Mitigation**: How does design handle growth challenges?
- **Integration Risk Mitigation**: How does architecture manage external dependencies?
- **User Adoption Risk Mitigation**: How does design support user success patterns?

### Step 4: Detailed Architecture Specification

**4A. System Architecture Diagram**
Create comprehensive architecture visualization:
- **Component Diagram**: All essential components and their relationships
- **Data Flow Diagram**: How information moves through the system
- **User Journey Mapping**: How architecture supports user workflows

**4B. Component Specifications**
**FPT-Based Component Definition**:

**For Each Component:**
- **Purpose**: What fundamental problem does this component solve?
- **Responsibilities**: What are its irreducible functions?
- **Interfaces**: What are its minimal necessary connection points?
- **Dependencies**: What other components does it fundamentally require?
- **Data Model**: What information does it manage?
- **Scalability Plan**: How does it handle growth?
```

**4C. Technical Stack Architecture**
Based on Phase 2 research and architectural requirements:
