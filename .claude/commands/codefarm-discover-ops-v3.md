# CODEFARM Intelligent Scenario Resolver v3.0

**Scenario:** $ARGUMENTS

## CODEFARM Multi-Agent Activation (Intelligent Resolution)

**CodeFarmer (Scenario Intelligence Analyst):** "I'll automatically analyze your scenario and determine the optimal solution path without requiring meta-decisions from you."

**Critibot (Solution Validator):** "I'll validate that recommendations are based on evidence and provide the most efficient path forward."

---

## AUTOMATIC SCENARIO RESOLUTION ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Scenario Understanding & Context Analysis

**CodeFarmer Automatic Scenario Intelligence:**

**Analyzing scenario keywords to classify task type:**

**Using pattern matching to detect scenario characteristics:**
- Searching for analysis indicators: "audit", "analyze", "assess", "validate", "systematize", "health", "quality", "debt", "issues", "problems"
- Searching for execution indicators: "deploy", "build", "pipeline", "workflow", "orchestrate", "automate", "setup", "create", "implement"
- Searching for organization indicators: "organize", "files", "scattered", "structure", "cleanup", "arrangement"
- Searching for resolution indicators: "resolve", "fix", "complex", "legacy", "multiple issues", "interconnected"

**Using LS tool to analyze existing command inventory**
Using LS tool with path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands

**Using Glob tool to find existing CODEFARM commands**
Using Glob tool with path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands and pattern: "codefarm-*.md"

### Step 2: Automatic Command Inventory Matching

**Programmatron Intelligent Command Mapping:**

**Reading existing command capabilities for automatic matching:**

**Using Read tool to analyze core command capabilities:**
Using Read tool with file_path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands/codefarm-audit-working.md
Using Read tool with file_path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands/codefarm-systematize-working.md  
Using Read tool with file_path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands/codefarm-resolve-gordian.md
Using Read tool with file_path: /workspaces/context-engineering-intro/.claude/commands/codefarm-organize-project.md

**AUTOMATIC SCENARIO â†’ COMMAND MATCHING ALGORITHM:**

### EXISTING COMMAND CAPABILITIES MAPPING:

**`/codefarm-audit-working` - Analysis & Validation Scenarios:**
- Keywords: "audit", "analyze", "assess", "validate", "health", "quality", "debt", "issues", "problems", "technical debt", "code quality", "systematic analysis"
- Use Cases: Code health assessment, technical debt discovery, quality validation, systematic analysis

**`/codefarm-systematize-working` - Methodology & Standards Scenarios:**  
- Keywords: "systematize", "methodology", "compliance", "standards", "organize code", "structure", "systematic development", "methodology integration"
- Use Cases: Methodology compliance, systematic code organization, development process integration

**`/codefarm-resolve-gordian` - Complex Resolution Scenarios:**
- Keywords: "resolve", "complex", "legacy", "multiple issues", "interconnected", "systematic resolution", "complex problems", "legacy systems"
- Use Cases: Complex legacy project resolution, multiple interconnected issues, systematic problem solving

**`/codefarm-organize-project` - File & Structure Organization Scenarios:**
- Keywords: "organize", "files", "scattered", "structure", "cleanup", "arrangement", "file organization", "project structure"
- Use Cases: File organization, project structure cleanup, scattered content coordination

### Step 3: Intelligent Solution Recommendation

**TestBot Automatic Decision Algorithm:**

**SOLUTION DECISION TREE:**

### PHASE A: EXISTING COMMAND MATCH CHECK

**IF scenario matches existing command capabilities:**
â†’ **RECOMMENDATION**: "Use `/[command-name]` - it's designed for [specific capability match]"
â†’ **RATIONALE**: "[Why this command fits the scenario]"
â†’ **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: "Run: `/[command-name] [context-path]`"

### PHASE B: COMMAND SEQUENCE ANALYSIS

**IF scenario requires multiple commands in sequence:**
â†’ **RECOMMENDATION**: "Use command sequence: `/[command-1]` â†’ `/[command-2]` â†’ `/[command-3]`"
â†’ **RATIONALE**: "[Why this sequence addresses the complete scenario]"
â†’ **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: "Start with: `/[first-command] [context-path]`"

### PHASE C: GAP ANALYSIS & NEW COMMAND GENERATION

**IF no existing command matches the scenario:**

**Automatic Framework Selection Based on Scenario Classification:**

**FOR ANALYSIS-HEAVY SCENARIOS** (validation, assessment, systematic analysis):
â†’ **FRAMEWORK**: FPT + CoT (First Principles + Chain of Thought)
â†’ **RATIONALE**: "Requires evidence-based analysis and systematic validation"
â†’ **CODEFARM PATTERN**: Sequential agent reasoning with documentation adherence

**FOR EXECUTION-HEAVY SCENARIOS** (deployment, automation, multi-phase workflows):
â†’ **FRAMEWORK**: HTN + CoT (Hierarchical Task Networks + Chain of Thought)  
â†’ **RATIONALE**: "Requires systematic multi-phase orchestration and conditional branching"
â†’ **CODEFARM PATTERN**: Parallel agent coordination with goal decomposition

**FOR HYBRID SCENARIOS** (complex resolution, implementation, transformation):
â†’ **FRAMEWORK**: FPT + HTN + CoT (Hybrid approach)
â†’ **RATIONALE**: "Requires both foundational analysis and systematic execution"
â†’ **CODEFARM PATTERN**: Analysis phase â†’ Execution phase with integrated validation

### Step 4: Immediate Action Path Generation

**Critibot Solution Validation & Action Path:**

**SOLUTION OUTPUT FORMAT:**

```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ SCENARIO RESOLUTION: [Scenario Summary]

### RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
**[EXISTING COMMAND | COMMAND SEQUENCE | NEW COMMAND NEEDED]**

### IMMEDIATE ACTION:
```bash
# Exact command to run right now
/[command-name] [arguments]
```

### RATIONALE:
[Why this solution is optimal for your scenario]

### EXPECTED OUTCOME:
[What this will accomplish for you]

### IF ISSUES ARISE:
[Fallback options or troubleshooting guidance]
```

## ENHANCED COMMAND GENERATION (When Needed)

### Step 5: Automatic New Command Specification
