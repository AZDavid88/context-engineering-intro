# Simple Operational Discovery Command

**Scenario:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task
Analyze the described scenario systematically to discover operational patterns, identify issues, and provide actionable recommendations based on evidence.

## Approach
**Apply thinking frameworks naturally:**
- **Systematic Analysis** (HTN): Break the scenario into logical investigation areas and subtasks
- **First Principles** (FPT): Question assumptions, verify claims through direct evidence
- **Chain of Reasoning** (CoT): Build findings progressively, document reasoning clearly

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Scenario Understanding and Scope Analysis
- Parse the scenario description to identify key operational areas
- Determine investigation scope and relevant file/directory targets
- Establish evidence collection strategy

### 2. Systematic Discovery Investigation
- Use LS and Glob to understand project structure and relevant components
- Use Grep to find patterns, issues, or operational indicators
- Read key files to verify assumptions and gather concrete evidence
- Build progressive understanding through systematic exploration

### 3. Pattern Analysis and Issue Identification
- Analyze discovered patterns for operational insights
- Identify concrete issues, inconsistencies, or improvement opportunities
- Document findings with specific evidence and locations
- Question each finding against first principles

### 4. Actionable Recommendation Development
- Develop specific, implementable recommendations based on evidence
- Prioritize recommendations by impact and feasibility
- Provide clear next steps with concrete actions
- Validate recommendations against scenario requirements

## Output Requirements
Create comprehensive analysis with:
- **Discovery Summary**: Key operational patterns and insights found
- **Issue Analysis**: Specific problems identified with evidence and locations
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized, actionable steps with clear rationale
- **Implementation Guidance**: Concrete next steps and validation criteria

## Quality Standards
- High confidence through systematic verification of all claims
- Evidence-based findings only - no assumptions without verification
- Clear, actionable recommendations with implementation paths
- Natural complexity appropriate for scenario scope and requirements
- Progressive reasoning documented throughout analysis

**Focus**: Practical operational discovery that provides immediate value through systematic investigation and evidence-based recommendations.
