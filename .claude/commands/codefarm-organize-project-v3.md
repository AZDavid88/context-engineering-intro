# CODEFARM Project Organization (WORKING VERSION)

**Target Project:** $ARGUMENTS

## CODEFARM Multi-Agent Activation (Systematic Organization)

**CodeFarmer (Organization Strategist):** "I'll analyze project structure using evidence-based categorization and design systematic organization strategy with 8-category framework for enhanced development workflow."

**Critibot (Safety Validator):** "I'll validate organizational accuracy, ensure safety protocols, and verify all changes maintain functionality through systematic evidence-based validation."

**Programmatron (Implementation Architect):** "I'll execute file organization using categorization framework, implement directory structures, and validate organizational improvements with methodology compliance."

**TestBot (Organization Validator):** "I'll verify organizational effectiveness, test import dependencies, and confirm systematic improvements achieved through comprehensive validation."

## Framework: FPT + CoT (First Principles + Chain of Thought)

### Phase A: Evidence-Based Project Analysis

**CodeFarmer Strategic Analysis:**

**CoT Reasoning**: "I need evidence-based understanding of current organization chaos before applying systematic categorization framework."

**First Principles Investigation:**
1. **Current Structure Assessment**: Use LS tool to understand project scale and file distribution patterns
2. **File Type Discovery**: Use Glob patterns (*.py, *.md, *.json, *.yaml) to categorize by evidence
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Use Grep for import patterns to understand relationships
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Use Grep for class/function patterns to assess implementation density
5. **Organization Issues**: Use Grep for debug_*, test_*, validate_* patterns to identify scattered utilities

**8-Category Framework Application:**
- **Core Implementation**: Files with main algorithms, engines, core business logic
- **Feature Modules**: Domain-specific implementations grouped by functionality  
- **Utility & Helpers**: Support functions imported across multiple modules
- **Configuration**: Settings, environment, and configuration management
- **Documentation**: All .md, specifications, guides, reports
- **Testing**: Test files, validation scripts, testing infrastructure
- **Scripts & Automation**: Debug utilities, validation tools, maintenance scripts
- **Data & Resources**: Data files, static assets, resource materials

### Phase B: Systematic Organization Implementation

**Programmatron Implementation Strategy:**

**CoT Reasoning**: "Organization must preserve functionality while creating systematic structure that enhances development workflow."

**Safety-First Execution:**
1. **Create Project Backup**: Generate timestamped backup with integrity validation
2. **Design Directory Structure**: Implement 8-category framework with methodology compliance
3. **Prioritized File Movement**: Move by risk level (docs â†’ scripts â†’ utils â†’ core)
4. **Import Dependency Updates**: Systematic path corrections with validation
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verify all functionality preserved throughout process

**Target Organization Structure:**
```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/core/              # Core algorithms and engines
â”œâ”€â”€ src/[features]/        # Feature-specific modules  
â”œâ”€â”€ src/utils/             # Shared utilities and helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration and settings
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # All documentation and reports
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Testing infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/               # Utilities and automation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ debug/            # Debug utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validation/       # Validation scripts  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/      # Integration tools
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities/        # Maintenance scripts
â””â”€â”€ data/                  # Data files and resources
```

### Phase C: Organization Validation & Quality Assurance

**TestBot Effectiveness Validation:**

**CoT Reasoning**: "Organization success requires measurable improvement in development workflow efficiency and systematic methodology compliance."

**Comprehensive Validation Protocol:**
1. **Import Resolution Testing**: Verify all import statements resolve correctly
2. **Functionality Preservation**: Confirm all existing capabilities maintained
3. **Navigation Efficiency**: Test improved project navigation and file discovery
4. **Methodology Compliance**: Validate organization follows systematic development principles
5. **Development Workflow**: Assess cognitive overhead reduction and efficiency gains
