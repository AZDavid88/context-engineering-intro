Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "import|from", output_mode: "count", and glob: "*.py" to assess dependency complexity

### Step 2: Report Content Analysis & Synthesis Preparation

**Programmatron Systematic Report Analysis:**

**Using Read tool to analyze discovered reports for comprehensive understanding**
Reading each discovered report file to extract:
- Critical issues and methodology violations
- Risk assessments and priority rankings  
- Technical debt quantification and impact analysis
- Systematic compliance gaps and remediation requirements
- Integration complexity and dependency analysis

**Report Classification Framework:**

## Phase B: First Principle Thinking Analysis & Problem Decomposition

### Step 3: FPT-Based Root Cause Analysis

**CodeFarmer FPT Strategic Decomposition:**

**First Principle Analysis Framework:**

**1. FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH IDENTIFICATION**
- What are the core purposes this system must fulfill?
- What are the immutable constraints and requirements?
- What are the genuine technical necessities vs accumulated complexity?

**2. ASSUMPTION CHALLENGE**
- Which current architectural decisions are based on assumptions vs evidence?
- What legacy patterns persist without current justification?
- Where does complexity serve genuine needs vs historical accident?

**3. SYSTEMATIC DECOMPOSITION**
- Break complex problems into independent, solvable components
- Identify root causes vs symptoms for each major issue
- Map interdependencies and critical resolution sequencing

**4. EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION**
- Validate all analysis against concrete project evidence
- Ensure resolution strategies address genuine needs
- Confirm safety and reversibility of all proposed changes

### Step 4: Critical Issue Correlation & Priority Matrix

**Critibot Enhanced Risk Analysis:**

**Multi-Report Issue Correlation:**
- Cross-reference critical issues across all discovered reports
- Identify hidden dependencies between seemingly separate problems
- Validate risk assessments against actual project evidence
- Challenge priority rankings for evidence-based accuracy

**FPT-Based Priority Matrix:**
```
PRIORITY 1 - FUNDAMENTAL BLOCKERS (Address First):
- Issues that prevent basic system functionality
- Methodology violations that compound other problems
- Safety risks that could cause data loss or system failure

PRIORITY 2 - SYSTEMATIC FOUNDATION (Build Upon):
- Architecture improvements that enable other fixes
- Process implementations that prevent issue recurrence
- Testing infrastructure that validates ongoing changes

PRIORITY 3 - OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES (Enhance Performance):
- Performance improvements with measurable impact
- User experience enhancements with clear value
- Technical debt reduction with long-term benefit
```

## Phase C: Systematic Resolution Strategy Development

### Step 5: FPT-Enhanced Resolution Planning

**Programmatron Systematic Resolution Architecture:**

**For Each Priority 1 Issue - Fundamental Resolution Design:**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Apply FPT to identify genuine underlying causes
- Distinguish between symptoms and fundamental problems
- Validate analysis against multiple report sources

**Resolution Strategy Design:**
- Design minimal viable solutions addressing root causes
- Ensure solutions are reversible and incremental
- Plan comprehensive validation at each step

**Safety-First Implementation Plan:**
- Complete backup procedures before any changes
- Incremental implementation with validation checkpoints
- Rollback procedures tested and ready at each stage

**Success Criteria Definition:**
- Measurable outcomes confirming issue resolution
- Integration testing requirements for change validation
- Performance benchmarks confirming no degradation

### Step 6: Complex File Systematization Strategy (FPT-Based)

**TestBot File Splitting Validation Framework:**

**For methodology-violating large files (>500 lines):**

**FPT Analysis of File Structure:**
- Identify genuine functional boundaries vs arbitrary organization
- Analyze import dependencies and coupling patterns
- Validate splitting strategies against actual usage patterns

**Systematic Splitting Strategy:**
```
1. RESPONSIBILITY ANALYSIS:
   - Map each function/class to its core responsibility
   - Identify natural module boundaries based on actual coupling
   - Validate boundaries against import and usage patterns

2. DEPENDENCY PRESERVATION:
   - Ensure all import relationships remain functional
   - Plan interface contracts between split modules
   - Validate external integrations remain unchanged

3. INCREMENTAL SPLITTING:
   - Phase 1: Create new module structure with imports
   - Phase 2: Move functions with comprehensive testing
   - Phase 3: Validate integration and performance
   - Phase 4: Clean up old file and update imports

4. SAFETY VALIDATION:
   - Comprehensive test suite execution at each phase
   - Performance benchmarking to ensure no degradation
   - Integration testing with external systems
   - Rollback procedures tested and ready
