# Test Working Command

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS

## Testing Direct Tool Invocations

Let me test the working patterns:

**Step 1: Directory Analysis**

Using LS tool to analyze directory at path: $ARGUMENTS

**Step 2: Python File Discovery**  

Using Glob tool to find Python files with path: $ARGUMENTS and pattern: "*.py"

**Step 3: Import Analysis**

Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "^import|^from.*import" and output_mode: "files_with_matches"

**âœ… Test Complete:** If you see tool invocations working above, then our approach is correct and the issue is with command caching.
