Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "api|API|endpoint|URL", output_mode: "files_with_matches" to identify external service integration

### Step 3: Current Organization Assessment & Strategy Development

**Critibot Evidence-Based Organization Analysis:**

**Using Read tool to analyze existing directory structure**
Reading existing directory organization to understand current patterns and identify systematic gaps

**File Organization Quality Assessment:**
- Root-level file scatter analysis and cognitive overhead measurement
- Directory structure systematic methodology compliance evaluation
- Import path complexity and maintainability assessment
- Configuration and documentation accessibility review

**Organization Strategy Development:**
- Evidence-based file categorization framework
- Systematic directory structure design
- Import dependency preservation strategy
- Safety protocol and backup procedure specification

### Step 4: Systematic File Categorization Framework

**CodeFarmer Evidence-Based Categorization Strategy:**

**PRIMARY CATEGORIZATION LOGIC:**

**1. CORE IMPLEMENTATION FILES**
- **Criteria**: Main business logic, core algorithms, primary system functionality
- **Target Directory**: `/src/core/` or `/core/`
- **Evidence**: Files with high import frequency, main classes, core business logic

**2. FEATURE/MODULE IMPLEMENTATION FILES**
- **Criteria**: Specific feature implementations, module-specific logic
- **Target Directory**: `/src/[feature-name]/` or `/[feature-name]/`
- **Evidence**: Files grouped by functional domain, related import patterns

**3. UTILITY & HELPER FILES**
- **Criteria**: Support functions, utilities, common helpers
- **Target Directory**: `/src/utils/` or `/utils/`
- **Evidence**: Files imported across multiple modules, general-purpose functions

**4. CONFIGURATION & SETTINGS FILES**
- **Criteria**: Configuration, environment variables, settings
- **Target Directory**: `/config/` or `/settings/`
- **Evidence**: Files containing configuration patterns, environment setup

**5. DOCUMENTATION FILES**
- **Criteria**: Documentation, specifications, guides
- **Target Directory**: `/docs/`
- **Evidence**: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst` files with documentation patterns

**6. TESTING FILES**
- **Criteria**: Test files, test utilities, test configurations
- **Target Directory**: `/tests/`
- **Evidence**: Files with test patterns, testing framework usage

**7. SCRIPTS & AUTOMATION FILES**
- **Criteria**: Utility scripts, automation, maintenance tools
- **Target Directory**: `/scripts/`
- **Evidence**: Executable files, automation patterns, utility functions

**8. DATA & RESOURCES FILES**
- **Criteria**: Data files, resources, static assets
- **Target Directory**: `/data/` or `/resources/`
- **Evidence**: Data file extensions, resource patterns

### Step 5: Directory Structure Design & Methodology Compliance

**Programmatron Systematic Directory Architecture:**

**EVIDENCE-BASED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:**

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                    # Core implementation (if not already organized)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # Core business logic and algorithms
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [domain-modules]/  # Feature-specific modules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/             # Shared utilities and helpers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                  # All documentation and specifications
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Complete testing infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                # Configuration and environment files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/               # Utility and maintenance scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                  # Data files and resources
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-specific]/    # Additional directories based on project needs
```

**METHODOLOGY COMPLIANCE VALIDATION:**
- Each directory serves single, clear responsibility
- File organization enhances rather than complicates import paths
- Structure supports systematic development workflow
- Organization reduces cognitive overhead and improves navigation

### Step 6: Implementation Plan Generation

**CodeFarmer Systematic Plan Creation:**

**Creating comprehensive implementation plan document:**

Using Write tool to create detailed implementation plan at $ARGUMENTS/docs/organization_implementation_plan.md

**Implementation Plan Contents:**
1. **Current State Analysis**: Complete assessment of existing organization patterns with file categorization
2. **Proposed Organization Structure**: Evidence-based directory architecture with 8-category framework rationale
3. **File Movement Specifications**: Detailed list of every file to be moved with source, destination, and category justification
4. **Safety Protocols**: Backup procedures, incremental validation, and rollback instructions
5. **Validation Checkpoints**: Quality assurance steps throughout implementation with import dependency testing
6. **Import Dependency Updates**: Required import statement modifications with before/after examples
7. **Expected Benefits**: Quantified improvements in organization and development efficiency

**Plan Validation & Feasibility Assessment:**

**TestBot Implementation Plan Validation:**
- Verify all proposed file movements maintain functionality using categorization framework

## PHASE B: PLAN-DRIVEN EXECUTION (User-Approved Only)

### EXECUTION SAFETY PROTOCOL

**Critibot Mandatory Safety Implementation:**

**STEP 1: COMPLETE PROJECT BACKUP**
```bash
# Create timestamped backup before any organization
BACKUP_TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_DIR="${PROJECT_PATH}.backup.organization.${BACKUP_TIMESTAMP}"
cp -r $ARGUMENTS "${BACKUP_DIR}"
echo "‚úÖ Backup created: ${BACKUP_DIR}"
```

**STEP 2: BACKUP INTEGRITY VALIDATION**
```bash
# Validate backup completeness
cd "${BACKUP_DIR}"
ORIGINAL_FILE_COUNT=$(find $ARGUMENTS -type f | wc -l)
BACKUP_FILE_COUNT=$(find . -type f | wc -l)
if [ "$ORIGINAL_FILE_COUNT" -eq "$BACKUP_FILE_COUNT" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Backup integrity verified: ${BACKUP_FILE_COUNT} files"
else
    echo "‚ùå Backup integrity check failed - execution halted"
    exit 1
fi
```
