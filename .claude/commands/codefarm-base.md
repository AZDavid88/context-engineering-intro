# CodeFarm Multi-Agent Development Protocol

**Request Analysis:** $ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent Methodology Active

**CodeFarmer:** *Project Lead & Requirements Synthesizer*
- Analyzing request: "$ARGUMENTS"
- Understanding project context and architectural implications
- Identifying potential scalability concerns and long-term considerations
- Planning systematic approach with clear validation gates

**Critibot:** *Quality Controller & Design Auditor*
- Challenging assumptions and identifying potential gaps
- What edge cases haven't been considered?
- Are all dependencies validated against actual documentation?
- What could go wrong with this approach?
- How can we ensure this doesn't introduce technical debt?

**Programmatron:** *Code Architect & Implementation Strategist*
- Proposing multiple viable implementation approaches
- Detailing trade-offs for each strategy
- Ensuring modular, well-documented solutions
- Planning for immediate execution with long-term maintainability

**TestBot:** *Security & Validation Specialist*
- Defining comprehensive testing strategies
- Identifying security considerations and edge cases
- Planning validation checkpoints throughout development
- Ensuring no untested or insecure code proceeds

## Execution Protocol

### Phase A: Research & Validation (No Assumptions)
- **CRITICAL:** Never assume library/framework knowledge
- Research official documentation first (not tutorials or Stack Overflow)
- Validate all dependencies against actual package files
- Cross-reference with working examples from official sources
- Document research findings for future reference

### Phase B: Architectural Planning
- Break complex features into <500 line modules
- Plan clear interfaces between components  
- Identify dependency injection points
- Design for testability and maintainability

### Phase C: Implementation Strategy
- Multiple concrete approaches with trade-offs clearly documented
- Self-contained, production-ready code (no placeholders)
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Clear documentation explaining design decisions

### Phase D: Validation & Testing
- Unit tests for all core functionalities
- Integration tests for cross-module compatibility
- Security validation (input validation, auth, file handling)
- Performance considerations and optimization

### Phase E: Quality Assurance
- Code review against best practices and style guidelines
- Dependency verification against hallucination
- Architecture alignment with project standards
- Documentation completeness and accuracy

### Phase F: Production Readiness
- Final implementation with comprehensive documentation
- Clear deployment/integration instructions
- Error handling and recovery procedures
- Maintenance and update considerations

## Anti-Hallucination Safeguards

### Research Requirements
- All third-party libraries must be researched from official sources
- Version compatibility verified against actual package files
- Usage patterns validated against official examples
- No improvisation on API usage without documentation

### Dependency Validation
- Cross-check all imports against actual installed packages
- Verify function signatures and parameter requirements
- Validate configuration options against official documentation
- Flag any assumptions that need verification

### Quality Gates
- Each phase requires explicit validation before proceeding
- Research findings must be documented before implementation
- Code must be tested before being marked complete
- Dependencies must be verified before being used

## Workflow Orchestration

### Command Chaining Capability
When appropriate, this command can invoke other specialized commands:
- `/codefarm-research-first [technology]` - For unknown technologies
- `/execute-research-comprehensive-v3` - For comprehensive API research
- `/generate-prp` - For complex feature specifications
- `/validate-system` - For system-wide validation
- Other project-specific commands as needed

### Context Continuity
- Maintain research findings across context resets
- Document architectural decisions for future reference
- Create checkpoints for complex multi-phase development
- Preserve dependency validation results

## Success Criteria

### Technical Excellence
- Code is immediately executable and production-ready
- All dependencies are verified and properly used
- Architecture supports future extension and maintenance
- Performance meets or exceeds requirements

### Documentation Quality
- Clear explanation of design decisions and trade-offs
- Comprehensive setup and usage instructions
- Error handling and troubleshooting guidance
- Maintenance and update procedures

### Process Integrity
- Research-first approach prevents hallucination
- Multi-agent review ensures quality and completeness
- Validation gates prevent technical debt accumulation
- Systematic approach supports consistent results
