# Phase 4: Technology Stack Research with CODEFARM + FPT Analysis

**Context**: You are using the CODEFARM methodology for systematic technology stack research and validation. This phase validates architectural technology decisions through comprehensive official documentation research and anti-hallucination protocols.

## Fundamental Operation Definition
**Core Operation**: Transform architectural technology stack decisions into validated, implementation-ready technology foundation through systematic research of official documentation, capabilities, and integration patterns.

**FPT Question**: What are the irreducible validation requirements to confidently implement with chosen technologies?

## Pre-Condition Validation
**Systematic Prerequisites Check:**

### Phase 3 Output Validation
```bash
# Validate Phase 3 completion
PROJECT_PATH="${ARGUMENTS%% *}"  # First argument is project path
TECHNOLOGIES="${ARGUMENTS#* }"   # Optional second argument is technologies

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/phases/completed/phase_3_architecture.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Phase 3 incomplete - architecture documentation not found"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/system_architecture.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: System architecture specification missing"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/technical_stack.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Technical stack specification missing from Phase 3"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/component_specifications.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Component specifications missing from Phase 3"
    exit 2
fi
```

### Step 4: Technology Risk Assessment & Mitigation
**TestBot Risk Validation with FPT:**

**4A. Technology Risk Matrix**
**FPT Question**: What are the fundamental risks of each technology choice?

Systematic risk assessment:
```markdown

- **Migration Paths**: If technology choice proves inadequate, what are the migration options?
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Can risk be mitigated through technology combinations?
- **Fallback Strategies**: What are the contingency plans if technology fails to meet requirements?

**4C. Implementation Risk Mitigation**
