## Phase A: Enhanced Operational Context Investigation

### Step 1: Evidence Collection + Strategic Context Analysis

**CodeFarmer Enhanced Evidence Collection:**

**Using LS tool to analyze directory structure for operational patterns**
Using LS tool with path: $ARGUMENTS to understand project organization

**Using Glob tool to discover file types and patterns**
Using Glob tool with path: $ARGUMENTS and pattern: "*.py" to find Python files
Using Glob tool with path: $ARGUMENTS and pattern: "*.js" to find JavaScript files  
Using Glob tool with path: $ARGUMENTS and pattern: "*.ts" to find TypeScript files
Using Glob tool with path: $ARGUMENTS and pattern: "*.md" to find documentation

**Using Grep tool to identify operational indicators**
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "TODO|FIXME|BUG|HACK|REFACTOR", and output_mode: "files_with_matches" to find improvement opportunities

**Using LS tool to analyze existing command patterns**
Using LS tool with path: .claude/commands to understand existing operational capabilities

**Enhanced Context Analysis Questions:**
Based on "$ARGUMENTS" and evidence above:

1. **Operational vs Process Gap Analysis**: Are these operational needs caused by process gaps in our 7-phase development methodology?
2. **User Workflow Evidence**: What specific coding scenarios consume disproportionate time or mental energy?
3. **Tool vs Training Analysis**: Would better training with existing tools solve these needs, or are new tools genuinely required?
4. **Strategic Impact Assessment**: How do these operational needs affect overall development effectiveness?

**[INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE: Wait for user responses with strategic context consideration]**

### Step 2: Enhanced Operational Pattern Investigation

**Critibot Enhanced Evidence Challenge:**

Based on user responses, systematically investigate with strategic lens:

**Strategic Evidence-Based Questions:**
- What concrete examples exist of these operational challenges?
- Do these challenges indicate development process failures or genuine operational gaps?
- What's the true frequency and impact of these scenarios?
- How do current manual approaches actually perform vs perceived inefficiency?

**Enhanced Operational Pattern Research using proven working patterns:**

**Using Grep tool to quantify operational needs**
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "TODO|FIXME", output_mode: "count", and glob: "*.py" to measure Python improvement needs
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "TODO|FIXME", output_mode: "count", and glob: "*.js" to measure JavaScript improvement needs
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "TODO|FIXME", output_mode: "count", and glob: "*.ts" to measure TypeScript improvement needs
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "TODO|FIXME", output_mode: "count", and glob: "*.md" to measure documentation improvement needs

**Using Glob tool to analyze existing CODEFARM capabilities**
Using Glob tool with path: .claude/commands and pattern: "codefarm-*.md" to inventory existing commands

**Using Grep tool to identify process workaround patterns**
Using Grep tool with path: $ARGUMENTS, pattern: "manual|workaround|hack", output_mode: "content", and glob: "*.md" to find process gaps

## Phase B: Enhanced Operational Need Validation

### Step 3: Strategic Gap Analysis (Enhanced)

**Programmatron Enhanced Gap Assessment:**

For each identified operational scenario, systematically analyze with strategic intelligence:

**Enhanced Gap Analysis Framework:**
```markdown
### Operational Scenario: [Specific scenario from user]

**Current Approach**: [How user currently handles this]
**Frequency + Impact Evidence**: [Actual time/effort data]
**Pain Points**: [Specific inefficiencies with measurement]
**Manual Steps**: [Detailed process breakdown]
**Decision Complexity**: [Analysis complexity assessment]
**Error Potential**: [Failure modes and consequences]

**STRATEGIC ANALYSIS (NEW):**
**Process Improvement Opportunity**: 
- Could better development process commands eliminate this need?
- Does this indicate a gap in our 7-phase methodology?
- Is this symptomatic of development process immaturity?

**Tool Necessity Assessment**:
- Is this genuinely unsolvable through process improvement?
- Does systematic approach provide clear benefit over process refinement?
- What's the strategic cost of tool proliferation vs process enhancement?

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Primary cause: Process gap / Tool gap / Training gap / Complexity inherent
- Secondary effects: What problems does this operational need create/solve?
- Strategic impact: How does solving this affect overall development effectiveness?
```

**Enhanced Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Operational need backed by concrete evidence with impact measurement
- [ ] Strategic analysis confirms tool necessity over process improvement
- [ ] Current approach genuinely inefficient with measurable improvement opportunity
