# Phase 6: System Implementation with CODEFARM + FPT Analysis

**Context**: You are using the CODEFARM methodology for systematic component implementation through specification-driven development. This phase transforms complete specifications into working, tested code with continuous validation against acceptance criteria.

## Fundamental Operation Definition
**Core Operation**: Transform detailed component specifications into working, tested code through disciplined specification-driven development with continuous validation against acceptance criteria and quality gates.

**FPT Question**: What are the irreducible implementation steps needed to create working code that perfectly fulfills all specified requirements without deviation or assumption?

## Pre-Condition Validation
**Systematic Prerequisites Check:**

### Phase 5 Output Validation
```bash
# Parse arguments
PROJECT_PATH="${ARGUMENTS%% *}"  # First argument is project path
COMPONENT="${ARGUMENTS#* }"      # Second argument is component name

# Validate Phase 5 completion
if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/phases/completed/phase_5_complete_specification.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Phase 5 incomplete - complete specification documentation not found"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -d "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/component_implementations" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Component implementation specifications missing from Phase 5"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/interface_contracts.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Interface contracts missing from Phase 5"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/quality_assurance.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Quality assurance specifications missing from Phase 5"
    exit 2
fi

if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/implementation_guide.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Implementation guide missing from Phase 5"
    exit 2
fi

# Validate specific component specification exists if component specified
if [[ "$COMPONENT" != "$PROJECT_PATH" && ! -f "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/component_implementations/${COMPONENT}.md" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Component specification not found for: $COMPONENT"
    echo "Available components:"
    ls -1 "$PROJECT_PATH/specs/component_implementations/" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.md$//' || echo "No component specifications found"
    exit 2
fi
```

- [ ] Phase 5 complete specification documentation with all implementation blueprints
- [ ] Component implementation specifications with detailed technical requirements
- [ ] Interface contracts with precise API and data format definitions
- [ ] Quality assurance framework with testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Implementation guide with comprehensive development guidance

## CODEFARM Multi-Agent Activation with FPT Enhancement

**CodeFarmer (Implementation Strategist with FPT):** 
"I'll apply First Principles Thinking to implement components systematically. We'll ensure every implementation decision traces back to specifications and serves fundamental requirements."

**Critibot (Code Quality Enforcer with FPT):**
"I'll challenge every implementation choice against specifications and acceptance criteria. No code proceeds without specification justification and quality validation."

**Programmatron (Specification-Driven Developer with FPT):**
"I'll implement code following specifications exactly, with continuous validation against interface contracts and acceptance criteria from all previous phases."

**TestBot (Implementation Validator with FPT):**
"I'll validate all implementation against specifications, run tests continuously, and ensure quality gates are met before any code is considered complete."

**3A. Fundamental Quality Validation**
**FPT Question**: What are the minimal quality checks needed to ensure implementation meets all specifications?

Systematic quality validation during implementation:
```markdown
**Quality Validation Protocol:**

#### Specification Compliance Validation
```python
# Unit tests validating specification compliance
def test_[component]_specification_compliance():
    """
    Test that [component] implementation fulfills specification:
    specs/component_implementations/[component].md
    
    Validates:
    - [Specific requirement 1]
    - [Specific requirement 2]
    - [Interface contract compliance]
    """
    # Tests following acceptance criteria exactly
    pass

def test_interface_contract_compliance():
    """
    Test that component implements interface contracts exactly:
    specs/interface_contracts.md - [specific contract]
    """
    # Tests validating interface contract compliance
    pass
```

#### Acceptance Criteria Validation
```python
def test_acceptance_criteria_[requirement]():
    """
    Test implementation against acceptance criteria:
    specs/quality_assurance.md - [specific acceptance criterion]
    
    Success criteria: [As specified in quality framework]
    """

    specs/quality_assurance.md - [performance criteria]
    
    Performance targets: [As specified in quality framework]
    """
    # Performance tests following specifications exactly
    pass
```
```

**3C. Security & Error Handling Validation**
Implement and test security and error handling as specified:
```markdown
**Security & Error Handling Implementation:**

#### Security Implementation
```python
# Security implementation following security specifications
def implement_security_requirements():

```

### Step 4: Implementation Validation & Quality Gate Assessment
**TestBot Implementation Validation with FPT:**

**4A. Complete Implementation Validation**
**FPT Question**: How do we validate that implementation perfectly fulfills all specifications without gaps or deviations?

Systematic implementation validation:
```bash
# Automated validation against specifications
echo "Running complete implementation validation..."

# Validate all tests pass
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Validate code quality meets standards
echo "Validating code quality standards..."
# Run linting and code quality checks as specified

# Validate performance requirements
echo "Validating performance requirements..."
# Run performance tests against benchmarks from specifications

# Validate security requirements
echo "Validating security requirements..."
# Run security validation as specified in quality framework

# Validate integration requirements
echo "Validating integration requirements..."
# Run integration tests against specifications
```

**4B. Specification Traceability Validation**
Validate every implementation element traces to specifications:
```markdown
**Traceability Validation:**

#### Requirements Traceability
- **Function-to-Requirement Mapping**: [Document which functions fulfill which requirements]
- **Interface-to-Contract Mapping**: [Validate all interfaces match contracts exactly]
- **Test-to-Acceptance-Criteria Mapping**: [Validate all acceptance criteria have tests]
- **Integration-to-Specification Mapping**: [Validate all integrations follow specifications]

#### Quality Gate Validation

- **Performance Gates**: [Validate performance meets requirements from specifications]  
- **Security Gates**: [Validate security implementation meets specifications]
- **Integration Gates**: [Validate integration works as specified]
```

**4C. Implementation Completeness Assessment**
Assess implementation completeness against all specifications:
