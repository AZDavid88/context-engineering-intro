## 🔬 DETAILED FEATURE COMPARISON

### Code Example Quality

**Playwright + Jina Result:**
```python
# COMPLETE implementation with all parameters
result = cf.run(
    "Tag the given text with the most appropriate category",
    context=dict(text=text),
    result_type=["Technology", "Science", "Politics", "Entertainment"]
)

# Full flow implementation
@cf.flow
def create_story():
    topic = cf.run(
        "Ask the user to provide a topic for a short story", interactive=True
    )
    # ... 50+ lines of complete workflow
```

**Brightdata + Jina Hybrid Result:**
```python
# SIMPLIFIED version missing parameters
result = cf.run(
    "Write a haiku about AI", 
    result_type=Poem
)

# Basic pattern only - no full workflow shown
```
