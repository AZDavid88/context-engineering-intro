```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backtesting/          # Strategy backtesting and analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/              # Configuration and settings management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                # Data collection and processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discovery/           # Asset discovery and filtering  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution/           # Trading execution and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring/          # System monitoring and observability
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategy/            # Strategy development and genetic algorithms
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Shared utilities and helpers
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Enforce 500-line file size limit - current violations require immediate remediation.

### **Phase 6: Integration - DEPLOYMENT EXCELLENCE ‚úÖ**

**Established Workflow:**
1. **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings with environment support
2. **Dependency Management**: Proper requirements and package management
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker-based deployment and testing
4. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive component integration validation

**Integration Components:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Complete development environment
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python package configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Production dependency management
- `config/` - Environment-specific configuration management

**Best Practice**: All integration components should be research-backed and environment-agnostic.

### **Phase 7: Validation - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING ‚úÖ**

**Established Workflow:**
1. **Structured Testing**: Organized `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/system/`
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Testing across all system components
3. **Validation Scripts**: Automated system validation and health checks
4. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous monitoring and health assessment

**Testing Structure:**
```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/                    # Unit tests for individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/             # Integration tests for component interaction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/                  # End-to-end system testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research_archive/        # Research and experimental testing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ comprehensive_seed_validation.py  # Specialized algorithm validation
```
