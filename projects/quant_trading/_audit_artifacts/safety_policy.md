# Deep Executable Truth Forensics BIS - Safety Policy

**Generated:** 2025-08-10T02:24:00Z  
**Target:** `/workspaces/context-engineering-intro/projects/quant_trading`  
**Audit ID:** audit-20250810-022400

## Executive Summary

This safety policy defines strict operational boundaries for the comprehensive executable forensics audit of the quantitative trading system. Given the sensitive nature of trading algorithms and potential for financial impact, maximum precautions are enforced.

## Scope Boundaries

### In-Scope Components
- **Source code analysis** (Python, Shell, SQL)
- **Configuration examination** (YAML, TOML, JSON) 
- **Build system discovery** (Docker, Poetry, Make)
- **Test infrastructure mapping** (Pytest, Integration tests)
- **Documentation and metadata** (Markdown, requirements)

### Explicitly Out-of-Scope
- **Live trading execution** - No real market interactions
- **Database modifications** - Read-only analysis of schemas
- **External API calls** - Network isolation enforced
- **Credential exposure** - No secret material access
- **Data file processing** - Parquet/DuckDB files excluded

## Safety Controls

### Network Isolation
- ✅ All external network access **DISABLED**
- ✅ Container-to-container networking **LIMITED**
- ✅ No API calls to exchanges or external services
- ✅ DNS resolution restricted to localhost

### Execution Sandbox  
- ✅ Repository mounted **READ-ONLY**
- ✅ Audit artifacts directory **WRITABLE ONLY**
- ✅ Process isolation with timeout enforcement
- ✅ No state modification of target system

### Command Probing Restrictions
- ✅ `--help` and `--version` flags **ONLY**
- ✅ Dry-run mode preferred where available
- ✅ 30-second maximum timeout per command
- ✅ Structured error logging required

### Data Protection
- ✅ No credential or API key exposure
- ✅ Trading algorithms examined but not executed
- ✅ Database connections read schema only
- ✅ Audit trails preserved immutably

## Risk Register

| Risk Type | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Accidental Trading Execution | Low | Critical | Network isolation, read-only mode |
| Credential Exposure | Medium | High | Structured logging, no secret scanning |
| System State Corruption | Low | Medium | Containerized execution, timeouts |
| Resource Exhaustion | Medium | Low | Process limits, timeout enforcement |

## Incident Response

1. **Immediate halt** of audit process if safety violation detected
2. **Artifact preservation** for forensic analysis
3. **System state verification** post-audit
4. **Stakeholder notification** within defined SLA

## Compliance Verification

- [ ] Network isolation verified
- [ ] Read-only access confirmed  
- [ ] Timeout mechanisms tested
- [ ] Logging infrastructure validated
- [ ] Sandbox boundaries established

**Authorization Required:** This audit requires explicit approval due to the sensitive nature of the quantitative trading system.
