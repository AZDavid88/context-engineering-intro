- [x] Identified truly redundant components

### ✅ During Cleanup Safety
- [x] Phase-by-phase execution with verification
- [x] No modification of active source code
- [x] Preservation of all entry points
- [x] System integrity maintained throughout

### ✅ Post-Cleanup Validation  
- [x] All critical entry points verified functional
- [x] Docker health checks preserved
- [x] Configuration files intact
- [x] No broken imports or missing dependencies
- [x] Audit artifacts updated to reflect changes

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

### Automated Cleanup Integration
1. **Pre-commit Hook:** Add bytecode cleanup to git hooks
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Include cache cleanup in build process  
3. **Development Workflow:** Regular cleanup as part of release process

### Monitoring Points
1. **File Count Tracking:** Monitor growth of orphaned files
2. **Cache Growth:** Watch for bytecode accumulation
3. **Archive Management:** Periodic review of research archives
4. **Documentation Drift:** Prevent duplicate report accumulation

### System Health Indicators
- **Execution Graph Fragmentation:** Target <70% (currently 85%)
- **Orphaned Node Count:** Target <50 (currently 90)
- **Active Test Coverage:** Maintain current 34 active test files
- **Storage Efficiency:** Keep bytecode cache at 0
