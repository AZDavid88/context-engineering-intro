## Risk Management & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Ray workers fail to connect to head node**
```bash
# Solution: Check network connectivity and firewall
docker-compose logs ray-head
docker network inspect quant_trading_genetic-cluster
```

**Issue: Out of memory errors during genetic evolution**
```bash
# Solution: Adjust Ray worker memory allocation
# Edit docker-compose.yml worker memory limits
# Reduce genetic algorithm population size temporarily
```

**Issue: Performance degradation with distributed setup**
```bash
# Solution: Profile task distribution
# Check Ray Dashboard for worker utilization
# Optimize genetic algorithm batch sizes
# Consider network latency issues
```

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Emergency rollback to single-machine mode
docker-compose down
python -m src.execution.genetic_strategy_pool --mode local
# System continues operation without distributed benefits
```

### Resource Requirements

**Minimum System Requirements:**
- RAM: 8GB+ (16GB recommended)
- CPU: 4+ cores (8+ recommended)  
- Storage: 50GB+ free space
- Network: Stable internet for API calls

**Cloud Deployment Scaling:**
- AWS EC2: c5.2xlarge or equivalent (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM)
- Auto-scaling group with 2-8 instances
- Spot instances for cost optimization
- EBS storage with appropriate IOPS
