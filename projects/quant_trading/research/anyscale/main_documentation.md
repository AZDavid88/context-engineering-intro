# Anyscale Main Documentation

## Overview
Anyscale is a platform that helps developers develop, debug, and scale Ray apps faster without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. For infrastructure engineers, Anyscale enables management of Ray clusters that meet unique infrastructure and governance needs across any cloud, stack, or accelerator.

## Key Components

### For Developers
- **Development**: Interactive development on Ray clusters using Anyscale workspaces
- **Model Serving**: Deploy ML models using Anyscale services powered by Ray Serve
- **Production Workloads**: Submit batch inference, offline training, and data processing pipelines using Anyscale jobs
- **CI/CD Integration**: Service accounts and CLI/SDK integration with CI/CD tools
- **Monitoring**: Workload dashboards, custom logging, logs and metrics viewing

### For Administrators
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy Anyscale clouds on AWS, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes
- **User Management**: SSO configuration, access controls, service accounts
- **Resource Management**: Resource quotas, machine pools, usage dashboards
- **Security**: Audit logs, secret management, data classification
- **Billing**: Budget controls, usage monitoring

## Core Architecture

### Cluster Definition Components
1. **Container Image**: Specifies compute environment including packages, dependencies, and environment variables
2. **Compute Config**: Defines number and type of Ray nodes, scaling behavior, and cloud-specific configurations

### Storage Model
- Ephemeral block storage local to each machine
- Ephemeral storage for sharing files across cluster nodes
- Default object storage for persisting files between workloads
- Shared storage for all users in a cloud
- User-specific shared storage

### Networking Options
- **Direct Networking**: Public subnets with public IP addresses (simplified setup)
- **Customer-Defined Networking**: Private subnets with custom networking configuration

## Production Considerations

### Scalability
- Heterogeneous compute support (CPUs and GPUs)
- Worker groups for different instance types
- Autoscaling capabilities
- Spot instance support with fallback to on-demand

### Monitoring and Debugging
- Ray Dashboard integration
- Hardware metrics (nodes, memory)
- Grafana integration for custom visualizations
- Application logs and workspace events
- Log retention and export capabilities

### Security
- IAM role-based access control
- Cloud provider IAM integration
- Secret management integration
- Audit logging
- Network security groups

## Integration Examples

### AWS Deployment
- VPC and subnet configuration
- IAM roles for cross-account access
- S3 integration for storage
- EFS for shared file systems
- Security group configuration
- CloudFormation stack management

This comprehensive platform supports the full development lifecycle from interactive development to production deployment of Ray-based applications.
