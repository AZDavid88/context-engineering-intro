## Overview

Each day, Alternative.me analyzes emotions and sentiments from different sources and crunches them into one simple number: The Fear & Greed Index for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies.

The index ranges from 0 to 100:
- **0**: Extreme Fear
- **100**: Extreme Greed

## Current Index Values

- **Now**: Greed (70)
- **Yesterday**: Greed (71) 
- **Last week**: Greed (73)
- **Last month**: Greed (66)

## Market Psychology & Strategy

### Why Measure Fear and Greed?

The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out). Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction of seeing red numbers. With the Fear and Greed Index, investors can save themselves from emotional overreactions.

### Two Key Trading Assumptions:

1. **Extreme fear** can be a sign that investors are too worried. That could be a **buying opportunity**.
2. When Investors are getting **too greedy**, that means the market is **due for a correction**.

## Data Sources & Methodology

The index is calculated from 6 different factors, each weighted differently:

### 1. Volatility (25%)
- **Method**: Measures current volatility and max drawdowns of bitcoin
- **Comparison**: Against 30-day and 90-day average values
- **Logic**: Unusual rise in volatility indicates a fearful market

### 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%)
- **Method**: Analyzes current volume and market momentum
- **Comparison**: Against 30/90 day average values
- **Logic**: High buying volumes in positive market = overly greedy/bullish behavior

### 3. Social Media (15%)
- **Platform**: Twitter analysis (Reddit analysis in development)
- **Method**: Gathers and counts posts on various hashtags for each coin
- **Metrics**: Interaction speed and quantity in specific time frames
- **Logic**: Unusual high interaction rate = grown public interest = greedy market behavior

### 4. Surveys (15%) - Currently Paused
- **Platform**: strawpoll.com partnership
- **Method**: Weekly crypto polls asking market sentiment
- **Sample Size**: Typically 2,000-3,000 votes per poll
- **Status**: Paused but historically useful for sentiment validation

### 5. Dominance (10%)
- **Method**: Bitcoin market cap share analysis
- **Logic For Bitcoin**: Rise in Bitcoin dominance = fear of speculative alt-coins (Bitcoin as safe haven)
- **Logic For Alt-coins**: Decreasing Bitcoin dominance = increased greed (more risky investments)

### 6. Trends (10%)
- **Source**: Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries
- **Metrics**: Search volume changes and related popular searches
- **Example**: +1,550% rise in "bitcoin price manipulation" searches indicates market fear

## Implementation Considerations for Quant Trading

### Market Regime Detection
- **Contrarian Signals**: Extreme fear (0-25) = potential buy zones, extreme greed (75-100) = correction signals
- **Genetic Algorithm Input**: Use as environmental pressure for strategy adaptation
- **Real-time Integration**: API polling for dynamic strategy selection

### Data Integration Pattern
```python
# Example integration pattern
import requests

def get_fear_greed_index(limit=1):
    """Fetch Fear & Greed Index data"""
    url = f"https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit={limit}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Multi-factor analysis integration
def analyze_market_regime(fng_data, volume_data, volatility_data):
    """Combine FnG with other market indicators"""
    fng_value = int(fng_data['data'][0]['value'])
    
    if fng_value <= 25:
        return "extreme_fear_buy_opportunity"
    elif fng_value >= 75:
        return "extreme_greed_correction_risk"
    else:
        return "neutral_trend_following"
```
