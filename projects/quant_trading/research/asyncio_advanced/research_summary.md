## Key Implementation Patterns for Trading Systems

### 1. Market Data Pipeline Architecture

```python
# High-throughput data processing with backpressure control
market_data_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=10000)

async def websocket_producer(queue):
    """WebSocket producer with automatic reconnection"""
    # Implementation with exponential backoff and error recovery

async def data_processor(name, queue, storage_engine):
    """Consumer with DuckDB/PyArrow integration"""
    # Processing with proper task coordination and cleanup
```

### 2. Robust Task Management

```python
class TradingSystemTaskManager:
    """Comprehensive task lifecycle management"""
    # TaskGroup usage for structured concurrency
    # Graceful shutdown with proper cancellation handling
    # Error recovery with exponential backoff
    # Performance monitoring and health checks
```

### 3. WebSocket Connection Management

```python
class HyperliquidWebSocketClient:
    """Production-ready WebSocket client"""
    # Custom frame parsing for protocol compliance
    # Flow control with stream-based architecture
    # Connection state management and recovery
    # Message handling with timeout protection
```

### 4. Exception Handling Framework

```python
class TradingSystemExceptionHandler:
    """Comprehensive error handling and recovery"""
    # Error classification by severity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
    # Circuit breaker patterns for fault isolation
    # Graceful degradation with fallback strategies
    # Emergency shutdown procedures
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring System

```python
class TradingSystemCoordinator:
    """System-wide coordination and monitoring"""
    # Thread-safe synchronization with mixed asyncio/threading
    # Resource management with semaphore control
    # Real-time performance metrics collection
    # Health monitoring and alerting
```

## Production Implementation Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- **Queue Sizing**: Use `maxsize=10000` for market data queues to prevent memory overflow
- **Buffer Management**: Configure `limit=2*1024*1024` (2MB) for WebSocket streams
- **Concurrency Control**: Limit concurrent processors with `asyncio.Semaphore(10)`
- **Thread Pool Integration**: Use `asyncio.to_thread()` for CPU-intensive calculations

### Error Recovery Strategies
- **Immediate Retry**: Network errors with <3 attempts
- **Exponential Backoff**: Data processing errors with 2^n delay
- **Circuit Breaker**: Service failures with 60-second recovery timeout
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Critical errors trigger immediate position closure

### Resource Management
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track queue depths and buffer usage
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections with proper cleanup
- **Task References**: Maintain strong references to prevent garbage collection
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Coordinate cleanup across all system components

### Monitoring and Debugging
- **Debug Mode**: Enable for development with `asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)`
- **Performance Metrics**: Track processing rates, queue depths, task counts
- **Error Classification**: Log errors by severity with appropriate context
- **Health Checks**: Monitor system components with periodic health assessments
