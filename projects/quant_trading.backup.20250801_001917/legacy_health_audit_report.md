     - `universal_strategy_engine.py`: 1,004 lines (201% over limit)
   - **Failure Scenario**: Unmaintainable code leads to bugs going undetected, team velocity collapse, and production failures
   - **Impact**: SEVERE - Violates core development methodology, creates technical debt spiral
   - **Mitigation**: IMMEDIATE refactoring into modular components following CLAUDE.md 500-line limit
   - **Testing Strategy**: Split files while preserving functionality, comprehensive integration testing

### **2. UNKNOWN DEPENDENCIES - Import Risk**
   - **Evidence**: Complex import chains with conditional fallbacks and research-archive legacy code
   - **Failure Scenario**: Missing dependencies cause runtime failures in production environments
   - **Impact**: HIGH - Production system could fail to start or crash during execution
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive dependency audit and cleanup of unused imports

### **3. TESTING COVERAGE GAPS - Unknown Unknowns**
   - **Evidence**: Large complex files (1500+ lines) with limited comprehensive testing
   - **Failure Scenario**: Critical business logic untested leading to financial losses
   - **Impact**: SEVERE - Quant trading requires 100% reliability for financial operations
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite for all genetic algorithms and trading logic
   - **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for every major component, integration tests for trading flows

### **4. RESEARCH ARCHIVE POLLUTION**
   - **Evidence**: `research_archive` directory mixed with active code, potential legacy dependencies
   - **Failure Scenario**: Deprecated code gets activated accidentally, causing system instability
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - Legacy code could interfere with production systems
   - **Mitigation**: Clean separation of research code from production systems
   - **Testing Strategy**: Validate no production dependencies on archived research

## üìä HIGH RISK ISSUES (Priority 2 - Address Soon)

### **Security Vulnerabilities**

- **Database Query Optimization**: Data storage patterns need efficiency review

## üìà MEDIUM RISK ISSUES (Priority 3 - Technical Debt)

### **Code Quality**
- **Duplicate Code**: Potential duplication across large files needs analysis
- **Import Organization**: Complex import patterns need standardization
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent exception handling patterns across codebase

### **Documentation Gaps**
- **Architecture Documentation**: Large codebase lacks clear architectural overview
- **API Documentation**: Internal APIs between components need documentation
- **Deployment Documentation**: Production deployment process needs clarity

### **Testing Coverage**
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-component testing needs expansion
- **Performance Testing**: Genetic algorithms need performance benchmarking
- **Load Testing**: Trading system needs stress testing under market conditions

## üîß LOW RISK ISSUES (Priority 4 - Future Improvements)

### **Code Style**
- **Formatting Consistency**: Black/isort configuration needs enforcement
- **Type Hints**: Enhanced type hint coverage for better maintainability
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming patterns across modules

### **Optimization Opportunities**
- **Async Operations**: More efficient async patterns for data collection
- **Memory Management**: Large data structures need memory optimization
- **Caching Strategies**: Repeated calculations need caching optimization
