## Overview

asyncio is a library to write **concurrent** code using the **async/await** syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level **structured** network code.

## High-Level APIs

asyncio provides a set of **high-level** APIs to:

- [run Python coroutines](asyncio-task.html#coroutine) concurrently and have full control over their execution;
- perform [network IO and IPC](asyncio-stream.html#asyncio-streams);
- control [subprocesses](asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio-subprocess);
- distribute tasks via [queues](asyncio-queue.html#asyncio-queues);
- [synchronize](asyncio-sync.html#asyncio-sync) concurrent code;

## Low-Level APIs

Additionally, there are **low-level** APIs for _library and framework developers_ to:

- create and manage [event loops](asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio-event-loop), which provide asynchronous APIs for [networking](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-create-server), running [subprocesses](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-subprocess-exec), handling [OS signals](asyncio-eventloop.html#loop-add-signal-handler), etc;
- implement efficient protocols using [transports](asyncio-protocol.html#asyncio-transports-protocols);
- [bridge](asyncio-future.html#asyncio-futures) callback-based libraries and code with async/await syntax.

## Hello World Example

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print('Hello ...')
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('... World!')

asyncio.run(main())
```

## asyncio REPL

You can experiment with an `asyncio` concurrent context in the [REPL](../glossary.html#term-REPL):

```bash
$ python -m asyncio
asyncio REPL ...
Use "await" directly instead of "asyncio.run()".
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import asyncio
>>> await asyncio.sleep(10, result='hello')
'hello'
```

## Implementation Notes

**Availability**: not WASI.
This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See [WebAssembly platforms](intro.html#wasm-availability) for more information.

The source code for asyncio can be found in [Lib/asyncio/](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/asyncio/).

## Quant Trading Implementation Relevance

This core overview provides the foundation for implementing:

1. **High-frequency data processing** through concurrent coroutines
2. **Real-time WebSocket connections** for market data feeds
3. **Producer-consumer patterns** via asyncio queues for data pipeline orchestration
4. **Network IO optimization** for trading system connectivity
5. **Task management and coordination** for multi-component trading systems
6. **Error handling and recovery** patterns for mission-critical trading operations

The structured approach to concurrency management is essential for building robust, high-performance quantitative trading systems that can handle real-time market data processing and execution.
