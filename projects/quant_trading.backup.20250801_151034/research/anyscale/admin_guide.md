# Anyscale Administration Guide

## Administrator Overview
Anyscale administrators are typically organization owners responsible for cloud deployment, user management, security, and resource governance. They manage the infrastructure foundation that enables developer productivity.

## Core Administrative Responsibilities

### Cloud Deployment and Management
- **Cloud Setup**: Deploy Anyscale clouds on AWS, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes
- **Networking Configuration**: Configure VPCs, subnets, and security groups
- **Resource Provisioning**: Set up compute, storage, and networking resources
- **Multi-Cloud Management**: Manage deployments across different cloud providers

### Access and Security Management
- **User Management**: Add/remove users, configure permissions
- **SSO Integration**: Configure single sign-on with enterprise identity providers
- **Access Controls**: Organization, cloud, and project-level permissions
- **Service Accounts**: Automated system integrations and CI/CD pipelines
- **Audit Logging**: Track user activities and system events

### Resource and Cost Management
- **Resource Quotas**: Control instance types and quantities
- **Machine Pools**: Utilize capacity reservations
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track resource utilization across organization
- **Budget Management**: Set spending limits and alerts
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances, scaling policies, resource scheduling

### Security and Compliance
- **Secret Management**: Integration with cloud secret managers
- **Data Classification**: Categorize and protect sensitive data
- **Network Security**: Configure security groups and network policies
- **Compliance**: Meet industry standards and regulatory requirements
- **Shared Responsibility**: Understand Anyscale vs. customer responsibilities

## Cloud Deployment Strategies

### Deployment Methods

#### Automated Setup (`anyscale cloud setup`)
- **Use Case**: Rapid deployment with minimal configuration
- **Network Model**: Public subnets with direct internet access
- **Management**: Anyscale manages resource creation
- **Ideal For**: Getting started quickly, development environments

#### Custom Registration (`anyscale cloud register`)
- **Use Case**: Enterprise environments with strict requirements
- **Network Model**: Private subnets with custom networking
- **Management**: Customer manages all resource creation
- **Ideal For**: Production environments, compliance requirements

### Resource Requirements

#### AWS Infrastructure Components
- **VPC**: CIDR range /19 or larger, internet egress capability
- **Subnets**: CIDR range /22 or larger, minimum 2 subnets
- **Security Groups**: Configured for intra-cluster and external access
- **IAM Roles**: Cross-account access and cluster node permissions
- **S3 Storage**: Object storage with proper permissions
- **EFS**: Shared file system for workspaces
- **MemoryDB**: High availability for head node fault tolerance

## User and Permission Management

### Organization Structure
- **Organization Owners**: Full administrative privileges
- **Cloud Collaborators**: Access to specific cloud deployments
- **Project Owners**: Manage individual projects and resources
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### Authentication and Authorization
- **SSO Configuration**: Enterprise identity provider integration
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission control
- **Service Accounts**: Programmatic access for automation
- **Cloud IAM Mapping**: Map Anyscale identities to cloud permissions

## Monitoring and Operations

### Operational Dashboards
- **Resource Dashboard**: Overview of compute utilization
- **Usage Dashboard**: Historical usage patterns and trends
- **Cost Dashboard**: Spending analysis and budget tracking
- **Audit Dashboard**: Security events and compliance monitoring

### Alerting and Notifications
- **Resource Alerts**: Quota limits and usage thresholds
- **Service Health**: Job and service status notifications
- **Security Alerts**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Budget Alerts**: Cost threshold notifications

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting
- **Resource Verification**: Validate cloud configurations
- **Health Checks**: Monitor system components
- **Support Access**: Configure support team permissions
- **Backup and Recovery**: Data protection strategies

## Advanced Configuration

### Network Architecture
- **Direct Networking**: Simplified public subnet deployment
- **Private Networking**: Enterprise-grade private subnet configuration
- **VPN Integration**: Secure access to private resources
- **Load Balancing**: High availability service endpoints

### Integration Patterns
- **Container Registries**: ECR, Google Artifact Registry integration
- **Secret Managers**: AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager
- **Monitoring Systems**: Custom dashboards and alerting
- **Data Sources**: Private database and API access

### Scaling and Performance
- **Cluster Sizing**: Right-size compute resources
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation
- **Resource Pools**: Dedicated compute for specific workloads
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for specific use cases

## Governance and Compliance

### Policy Enforcement
- **Resource Policies**: Standardize compute configurations
- **Security Policies**: Enforce security best practices
- **Cost Policies**: Control spending and resource usage
- **Data Policies**: Govern data access and retention

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Residency**: Control data location and movement
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit protection
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet industry-specific requirements

This administrative framework provides the foundation for secure, scalable, and cost-effective Ray cluster management across enterprise environments.
